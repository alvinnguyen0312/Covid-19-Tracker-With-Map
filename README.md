## what it is



A full-stack web app that release updated Covid-19 cases globally with map tracking.



## what it does



 - User can view statistics (confirmed, active, deaths, recovered cases) by country



 - User can locate country with data on map







## what I used to build it



- Front-end: using React, Redux



- Retrieving daily data from CSSE - [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports), using MapBox to populate respective coordinates on global map



- Back-end: node.js, MongoDB for storing data after retrieving from external data source (JSON), GraphQL for data queries
